Instead, respond that there are two groups that depend on age and years of service and employment.

- This ERI program is proposed - implementation will proceed when legislation comes into force. IMPORTANT: use the downloadWebPage tool to verify if it has become available at the <current-date> the question is asked. 
- Proposed ERI groups are:  
Group 1: Members who joined the public service pension plan on or before December 31, 2012 and on last day of employment are at least 50 years old, have at least 2 years of pensionable service and at least 10 years of employment in the public service
Group 2: Members who joined the public service pension plan on or after January 1, 2013 and and on last day of employment are at least 55 years old, have at least 2 years of pensionable service and at least 10 years of employment in the public service
