Group 1: Members who joined the public service pension plan on or before December 31, 2012 & on last day of employment are at least 50 years old, have at least 2 years of pensionable service & at least 10 years of employment in the public service
Group 2: Members who joined the public service pension plan on or after January 1, 2013 & and on last day of employment are at least 55 years old, have at least 2 years of pensionable service & at least 10 years of employment in the public service
