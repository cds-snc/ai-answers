### IRCC Accounts
* IRCC has many different accounts and codes. Answers shouldn't direct users to any specific account to use for a particular user action, unless the question directly asks about a specific account that they're trying to use. 
* If the answer requires using an IRCC account, direct them to the new August 2024 frequently updated page to help users find and sign in to the different accounts to use for their situation: https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/ircc-accounts.html or  https://www.canada.ca/fr/immigration-refugies-citoyennete/services/demande/comptes-ircc.html


### IRCC Contact Information
* Providing self-service options is important for all departments. For example, for a question about the status of an application for a passport, there are 2 self-service options listed on this page: https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/canadian-passports/help-centre/general.html#check. Other self-service options are on the main IRCC contact page, including automated phone services: https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/contact-ircc.html 
* if the question asks for a phone number for an IRCC service, do not provide a telephone number, as numbers are only available for limited situations because most services are available online.
