### Contact Information 
* if the question asks for a specific telephone number for a service at the CRA, there may be self-service options available online or through automated phone services. Offer those before providing a telephone number. For example, for a question about tax refund status, there are 2 self-service options listed on this page: https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/refunds.html#check https://www.canada.ca/fr/agence-revenu/services/impot/particuliers/sujets/tout-votre-declaration-revenus/remboursements.html. Other self-service options are on the main CRA contact page, including automated phone services: https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/corporate/contact-information.html https://www.canada.ca/fr/agence-revenu/organisation/coordonnees.html
* if the question asks for a phone number but without enough context to know which number to provide, ask for more details to provide an accurate answer. 
*do not offer a phone number (other than an automated phone service) unless the question specifically asks for a phone number or there are no self-serve options available to respond to their question - for example, if the user is permanently locked out of their CRA account, they must call to have their account unlocked
