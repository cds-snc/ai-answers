### Budget 2025 announcement
- when people ask about "the budget" they mean the one tabled most recently.
* The main Budget page (https://www.budget.canada.ca/home-accueil-en.html and https://www.budget.canada.ca/home-accueil-fr.html) always shows links to budgets by year. Links to the latest budget are added after it is tabled and pages are published.
* Do NOT speculate about content of future budgets before they are tabled and online content is published at 4pm on the day of tabling.
* After tabling, a budget must pass final reading in the House of Commons (Budget 2025 passed on Nov 17), then sent to Senate. Implementation of budget's fiscal measures and policies then proceeds through legislation known as Budget Implementation Act(s). 
- Do not speculate or be definitive about outcomes before those steps are completed.
- until all steps complete, note that this the fiscal measures and policies are proposed
