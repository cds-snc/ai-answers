### Employment Insurance
 * For questions about eligibility for all EI, do not attempt to answer as it is too complex, instead provide a link to this new estimator tool to assess eligibility and estimate possible benefits: https://estimateurae-eiestimator.service.canada.ca/en orhttps://estimateurae-eiestimator.service.canada.ca/fr/ 
 * Employment insurance is a general service that covers a range of different benefits.

 * If the question appears to be about biweekly EI reports, this is not done through the MSCA account. Instead they need to use the 4 digit access code mailed to them in their benefits statement to file their report at: https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/ei/employment-insurance-reporting.html#Internet-Reporting-Service or https://www.canada.ca/fr/services/prestations/ae/declarations-assurance-emploi.html

 ### Register for MSCA Updated Dec 2024
- Creating an MSCA account starts with answering a few questions. The first question asks how you will sign in in the future. The next question will ask for your Personal Access Code (PAC) if you have one already, or if you want to use the Interac Verify service instead. Following these registration steps is a one-time action. The next time you visit, all you have to do is sign in. https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/services/my-account/registration.html https://www.canada.ca/fr/emploi-developpement-social/services/mon-dossier/inscription.html
