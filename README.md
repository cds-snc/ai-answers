# AI Answers - Government of Canada AI Assistant

## Overview

AI Answers is a specialized AI chat application designed for Government of Canada websites. It provides highly accurate, brief answers to user questions about government services, programs, and information, with a single citation to an official government source or next step of their task. AI Answers is model-independent, with an innovative evaluation system that uses detailed human expert evaluations to fuel automated AI evaluations and accurate answers. An extensive Admin interface supports evaluation, metrics, user management, and logging views.

### Safety & Compliance
- **Content filtering**: Blocks inappropriate content, threats, and manipulation attempts
- **Rate limiting**: 3 questions per session to prevent abuse
- **Character limits**: 260 character limit per question
- **PI protection**: Most personal information not sent to AI services or logged (some names may slip through)
- **Official languages**: Compliant with Canadian official languages requirements

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components
- **Frontend**: React-based chat interface with Canada.ca design system
- **Backend**: Node.js microservices with prompt-chaining architecture
- **AI services**: Azure OpenAI GPT models (production)
- **Database**: AWS DocumentDB (production)
- **Deployment**: Azure cloud

## ðŸŒŸ Key Features

### Tuned for Canada.ca User Needs
- AI response is tagged so sentences in answer can be displayed in accessible canada.ca format and single citation url can be displayed for next step of task, with clickable link
- Assumes the AI service will be called from a specific canada.ca page, and uses the referral url to pass that information to the AI service
- System prompt forces short answers of a maximum of 4 sentences to improve clarity, use plain language, and reduce risk of hallucinations
- Scenarios address top user issues, top task issues and general GC instructions for the AI service to answer the question accurately and provide a citation url for all answers sourced from canada.ca or gc.ca sites
- Takes advantage of canada.ca interaction patterns and support - e.g. if a wizard is already in place, direct the user to answer those questions rather than having the AI service attempt to answer
- **Department-aligned**: Departments can provide prompt scenarios to address specific communications needs
- Since GC pages are added and updated frequently, the AI agent uses the downloadWebPage tool to read the page if it identifies a new, updated or unfamiliar url

### 2-Stage Privacy Protection & Content Filtering
- **Stage 1 - Initial Redaction**: RedactionService filters profanity, threats, manipulation attempts, and common PI patterns (phone numbers, emails, addresses, SIN numbers)
- **Stage 2 - AI PI Detection**: Specialized PI Agent performs intelligent detection of any personal information that slipped through, particularly names and personal identifiers
- When PI is detected at either stage, users are alerted and the question is blocked to protect privacy
- Most personal information never reaches AI services or gets logged to the database
- Government form numbers, product serial numbers, and public reference codes are explicitly preserved
- Usability testing of this feature showed users were successful at understanding the instructions and asking the question without specific threat words

### Official Languages Support
- Matches canada.ca spec with EN and FR official translated versions of the main AI Answers page
- Users can ask questions in any language on either page, but the citation url will be to an English canada.ca or gc.ca URL if the user is asking from the English AI Answers page, and to a French citation url if the user is asking from the French AI Answers page
- Language selector also available in batch process
- Context service loads Canada.ca French menu structure and FR department and agency names and urls
- System prompt scenarios and updates all include English and French citation urls pairs when a scenario or example suggests a specific url be used for related questions
- All text displayed to users in JSON language files for easy updates and translations in the locales folder

### AI Service Provider Independence
- Original design was tested with two AI service providers for exploration of strengths and weaknesses of different models
- On this repo, only OpenAI GPT latest model is currently supported
- Failover was in place, to switch to the other AI service if one fails - with only one service, will need to pull product out of service when ai performance is degraded or down. Setting to turn it off and display a message is provided in the Admin interface
- Prompt caching implemented to improve response quality and speed
- Temperature set to 0 for more deterministic responses for both models
- Conversation history management - pass conversation history to AI service for context in 'message' field
- Enhanced citation handling - the AI calls a tool to check if the citation url is valid and if not, finds another url, finally failing to a search link if no url is found
- System prompts optimized for 2025 model compatibility

### Evaluation-Driven Design (>95% Answer Accuracy Target)
- **Expert evaluation system**: 
  - **In-app evaluation**: Experts evaluate questions within the actual app interface, in the same view as a user would experience
  - **Flexible evaluation**: Experts can enter their own questions or use existing chat IDs to evaluate user conversations
  - **Sentence-level scoring**: Each sentence in AI responses is scored individually (100/80/0 points) with detailed explanations logged and embedded into the database for use by the AI
  - **Citation rating**: Separate scoring for citation accuracy and relevance (25/20/0 points)
  - **Weighted total score**: 75% sentence scores + 25% citation score for comprehensive quality assessment
  - **Embedding generation**: Expert feedback creates embeddings that enable automated AI evaluations for similar questions
  - **Future enhancement**: These embeddings will soon assist in answering questions quickly and accurately
- **Separate public user feedback**: 
  - **Simple interface**: "Was this helpful?" with Yes/No options for all users
  - **Detailed follow-up**: Single question asking why they clicked Yes or No with specific reason options
  - **Positive reasons**: No call needed, no visit needed, saved time, other
  - **Negative reasons**: Irrelevant, confusing, not detailed enough, not what they wanted, other

### Accessibility Features
- Usability sessions were held with people who rely on a range of screenreader assistive technologies to identify improvements that met their needs
- Note that the response is formatted and complete before it is displayed or announced - no streaming
- Aria-labels for helpful context, use of Aria-live to announce answers and error messages

## Technical Architecture

### Microservices Prompt-Chaining Architecture
- **Prompt-chaining architecture** to improve response quality and speed [see diagram](#architecture-diagram)
- **LangChain React agents** for both context and answer generation with tool integration
- **Chain of thought** - the system uses multiple AI agents in sequence for processing:
  - **Query Rewrite Agent**: Translates questions and crafts optimized search queries (keeps French questions in French for French page searches)
  - **Context Agent**: Gathers relevant government content and identifies departments (called for **every question**, including follow-on questions, to ensure fresh context derivation)
  - **Answer Agent**: Generates responses with preliminary checks including department analysis and content verification
- **Agentic tool usage** - AI agents can autonomously use specialized tools for enhanced responses
- **Multi-provider support** - Azure OpenAI (production), OpenAI, and Anthropic Claude models
- **Context Derivation**: Fresh context is derived for each question using the `DefaultAlwaysContext` workflow, ensuring follow-on questions have updated context based on conversation history

### Agentic Tool Use
The application uses LangChain React Agents with specialized tools to enhance AI interactions:

- **Canada.ca search tool** - Performs searches on government websites
- **Google context search tool** - Alternative search provider for broader context
- **URL status checker** - Validates citation URLs before including in responses
- **Web page downloader** - Downloads and parses web page content for accuracy
- **Context agent tool** - Coordinates context generation and department analysis

For detailed information about the agentic architecture and tool integration, see the [System Card](SYSTEM_CARD.md#agentic-tool-use).
