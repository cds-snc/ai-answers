# AI Answers - Government of Canada AI Assistant

## Overview

### Overview
AI Answers is a specialized AI chat application designed exclusively for Government of Canada websites. It provides highly accurate, brief answers to user questions about government services, programs, and information, with a single citation to an official government source or next step of their task. An extensive Admin interface supports  evaluation, metrics, user management, and logging views.

## ðŸŒŸ Key Features

### Tuned for Canada.ca user needs
   
- AI response is tagged so sentences in answer can be displayed in accessible canada.ca format and single citation url can be displayed for next step of task, with clickable link 
- assumes the AI service will be called from a specific canada.ca page, and uses the referral url to pass that information to the AI service. The referral url is either passed to the AI service from the chat interface for testing purposes, or from the query tag on the call of the application. The query tag is the url of the page that AI Answers is called from - it must be encoded properly.
- system prompt forces short answers of a maximum of 4 sentences to improve clarity, use plain language, and reduce risk of hallucinations.
- scenarios address top user issues, top task issues and general GC instructions for the AI service to answer the question accurately and provide a citation url for all answers sourced from canada.ca or gc.ca sites.
- takes advantage of canada.ca interaction patterns and support - e.g. if a wizard is already in place, direct the user to answer those questions rather than having the AI service attempt to answer. AI services aren't optimized for layers of question logic and aren't effective for that purpose.
- **Department-aligned**: Departments can provide prompt scenarios to address specific communications needs, such as sending particular questions to a wizard rather than attempting to answer, or overcoming outdated content issues by directing to most recent content
- since GC pages are added and updated frequently, the AI agent uses the downloadWebPage tool to read the page if it identifies a new, updated or unfamiliar url (from the search results, the contextual scenario and update files, or the referral url)
- PI is redacted programmatically in the code, no PI is sent to the AI service or logged into the database. When PI is detected in the user question, the user is alerted that the question will not be sent to the AI service to protect their privacy, and that they should ask the question without private personal details.
- Threats,manipulation and obscenity redaction is also in place. Similar to PI, the user is alerted that the question will not be sent to the AI service, and that they should ask the question differently. Usability testing of this feature showed users were successful at understanding the instructions and asking the question without specific threat words.

### Official languages support

- Matches canada.ca spec with EN and FR official translated versions of the main AI Answers page
- Users can ask questions in any language on either page, but the citation url will be to an English canada.ca or gc.ca URL if the user is asking from the English AI Answers page, and to a French citation url if the user is asking from the French AI Answers page.
- Language selector also available in batch process
- Context service loads Canada.ca French menu structure and FR department and agency names and urls
- System prompt scenarios and updates all include English and French citation urls pairs when a scenario or example suggests a specific url be used for related questions
- All text displayed to users in JSON language files for easy updates and translations in the locales folder

### Independent of AI service provider

- original design was tested with two AI service providers for exploration of strengths and weaknesses of different models
- On this repo, only OpenAI GPT latest model is currently supported 
- Failover was in place, to switch to the other AI service if one fails - with only one service, will need to pull product out of service when ai performance is degraded or down. Setting to turn it off and display a message is provided in the Admin interface. 
- Prompt caching implemented to improve response quality and speed
- Temperature set to 0 for more deterministic responses for both models
- Conversation history management - pass conversation history to AI service for context in 'message' field
- Enhanced citation handling - the AI calls a tool to check if the citation url is valid and if not, finds another url, finally failing to a search link if no url is found
- System prompts optimized for 2025 model compatibility

### Innovative evaluation-driven design to target >95% answer accuracy
- **Expert Evaluation System**: 
  - **In-App Evaluation**: Experts evaluate questions within the actual app interface, in the same view as a user would experience
  - **Flexible Evaluation**: Experts can enter their own questions or use existing chat IDs to evaluate user conversations
  - **Sentence-Level Scoring**: Each sentence in AI responses is scored individually (100/80/0 points) with detailed explanations logged and embedded into the database for use by the AI
  - **Citation Rating**: Separate scoring for citation accuracy and relevance (25/20/0 points)
  - **Weighted Total Score**: 75% sentence scores + 25% citation score for comprehensive quality assessment
  - **Embedding Generation**: Expert feedback creates embeddings that enable automated AI evaluations for similar questions
  - **Future Enhancement**: These embeddings will soon assist in answering questions quickly and accurately
- **Separate Public User Feedback**: 
  - **Simple Interface**: "Was this helpful?" with Yes/No options for all users
  - **Detailed Follow-up**: Single question asking why they clicked Yes or No with specific reason options
  - **Positive Reasons**: No call needed, no visit needed, saved time, other
  - **Negative Reasons**: Irrelevant, confusing, not detailed enough, not what they wanted, other


### Accessibility features tested with screenreader users
- usability sessions were held with people who rely on a range of screenreader assistive technologies to identify improvements that met their needs
- Note that the response is formatted and complete before it is displayed or announced - no streaming
- Aria-labels for helpful context, use of Aria-live to announce answers and error messages

## Microservices prompt-chaining architecture and Chain of Thought

- **Prompt-chaining architecture** to improve response quality and speed [see diagram](#microservices-prompt-chaining-architecture-diagram)
- **LangChain React Agents** for both context and answer generation with tool integration
- **Chain of Thought** - the answer service outputs preliminary checks to help derive answers, including:
  - Translation of non-English questions to English
  - Gathering possible citation URLs from context service and system prompts
  - Department and topic analysis
  - Content verification and validation
- **Agentic Tool Usage** - AI agents can autonomously use specialized tools for enhanced responses
- **Multi-Provider Support** - Azure OpenAI (production), OpenAI, and Anthropic Claude models

## Agentic tool use

The application uses LangChain React Agents with specialized tools to enhance AI interactions:

- **Canada.ca Search Tool** - Performs searches on government websites
- **Google Context Search Tool** - Alternative search provider for broader context
- **URL Status Checker** - Validates citation URLs before including in responses
- **Web Page Downloader** - Downloads and parses web page content for accuracy
- **Context Agent Tool** - Coordinates context generation and department analysis

For detailed information about the agentic architecture and tool integration, see the [System Card](SYSTEM_CARD.md#agentic-tool-use).

## Evaluation System

### Expert Evaluation
